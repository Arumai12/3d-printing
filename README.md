# 3D Printing

Repository of 3D models and STL files designed with [Autodesk 123D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_123D) (no longer in circulation)
and [OpenJSCAD V1](https://github.com/jscad/OpenJSCAD.org/tree/V1) (deprecated in favor of V2).

This project's focus has shifted to the [3d-modeling](https://github.com/rachidlamouri/3d-modeling) repository.
Once the 3d-modeling project is in a stable state, it can be used to add more models to this repository.

The models in this project are for 3D printing various things around the house.
